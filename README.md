# NEAT-Snake

Using the NEAT python module to teach an AI to learn to play the game of snake. Currently the most food I've been able to get a snake to eat is ~22 on a 10x10 board after about 500 generations of training. I am currently testing different settings to see how I could improve on this.

## To run:

To run the training model: python neat_snake.py
